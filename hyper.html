        <p class="para">Hyperspace is best understood as a sub-region of our real space where the same physical laws don’t apply. How does science fiction suggest we get there? It’s hard to say: Hyperspace has no theoretical basis like Einstein-Rosen bridges or warp drives.

            In the Star Wars films, all kinds of ships are equipped with hyperspace drives, from small personal fighters like Poe Dameron’s X-wing, to larger freighters like the Millennium Falcon. Even that massive moon-sized space station, the Death Star, has a hyperdrive. How? We don’t know. George Lucas was determined to make space fantasy rather than science fiction.
            
            In this case, “hyperspace” may merely be another name for lightspeed travel. In the original Star Wars, Han Solo brags his ship “can make point 5 past light speed.” In Star Wars novels — both the ones that are no longer canon(opens in a new tab) and those that are — we are told that ships are arranged by “class,” which corresponds to their speed. The lower the class, the faster the ship; the Falcon became a speedy Class 0.5 vessel.</p>

        <p class="p2">The hyperspace idea appears throughout science fiction, though different authors use different names to describe the same concept. The video-game series Halo uses the term “slipstream;” the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000 calls it the “Immaterium;” the YA series Animorphs uses “Z-space;” the comic book and movie Valerian calls it "Exospace;" Frank Herbert’s Dune series describes navigators “folding space” to travel great distances.

            All of this narrative convenience leaves the actual mode of entering and exiting a “hyper” state a mystery — one that is farther outside the realm of possibility than wormholes or warp engines. </p>
