        <p class="para">Hyperspace and warp drives describe a means of traveling way over the speed of light, but both still take a quantifiable amount of time. Han Solo, Luke and Obi-Wan had time to hang out and chat about the Force before they arrived at Alderaan. But what if you could get there in no time at all, avoiding what Douglas Adams called “all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace?” The Jump Drives in Battlestar Galactica made interstellar teleportation possible with virtually no delay. Both human ships and their Cylon counterparts used FTL drives. We were told the human ships are powered by refined tylium — an incredibly rare ore 10 million times more energetic than gasoline. We were also told that when a ship jumps, it warps the space around it and can damage other nearby vessels.</p>

        <p class="p2">As with hyperspace, jump drives apparently require complex calculations before and during a jump to avoid the risk of a ship materializing too close to a planet’s atmosphere — or within the planet itself. Instantaneous teleportation is a convenient trope in sci-fi tales; it’s even used in Star Trek to “beam” individuals between ships and planets below.</p>
