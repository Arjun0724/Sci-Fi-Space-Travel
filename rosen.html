        <center><h1>EINSTEIN-ROSEN BRIDGES</h1></center>
        <p class="para">Also known as wormholes, Einstein-Rosen bridges are perhaps the most commonly known means of interstellar travel and the most likely to actually exist. Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted wormholes, although we haven’t seen one yet.An Einstein-Rosen bridge, to put it as simply as possible, is a shortcut through space caused by the warping of spacetime. Massive objects like stars or black holes bend time and space like a bowling ball on a trampoline. A massive enough object could bend spacetime to create a connection between two otherwise distinct points.
         The entrance to a wormhole has often been represented as a tube, which makes sense given the name. But it’s also inaccurate. Interstellar, in one of its most intense scenes, got it right. From our perspective in 3-D space, a wormhole should look like a sphere.</p>

        <p class="p2">Wormholes are an attractive approach to FTL technology because they don’t require you to break the speed of light. Physics tells us nothing can go faster than light. But with wormholes shortcuts, basically spacecraft could enter and exit at sub-light speeds. That makes them a perfect fit for any fictional plot, allowing a quick way to get from Point A to Point B. In Douglas Adams’ satirical Hitchhiker’s Guide, the Earth was demolished by the Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass a wormhole by any other namewhich would supposedly speed up galactic travel.</p>
