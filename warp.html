        <center><h1>WARP ENGINES</h1></center>
        <p class="para">Warp technology is synonymous with the Star Trek series. Even if you’re not a fan of the various Starfleet adventures that have hit our screens over the last 50 years, you’re probably familiar with terms like “warp factor five.” Like an Einstein-Rosen bridge, warp technology skirts around the impossibility of accelerating a ship past the speed of light. Instead, a warp drive bends space itself. It compresses space in front of the craft and expands it behind. The Enterprise is basically riding a bubble of regular 3-D space while the universe changes around it. Star Trek’s different warp speeds aren’t just technobabble(opens in a new tab). According to the writer’s guide for The Original Series, warp factor one is equal to breaking the light barrier; warp two is equal to 8x the speed of light; warp three is 27x light speed. Warp six is common cruising speed for the USS Enterprise NCC-1701. Any speed above seven risks damage to the engines or the ship itself. Without warp technology, as we saw in the movie Star Trek: First Contact, humans never would have met spacefaring races like the Vulcans or founded the United Federation of Planets.</p>

        <p class="p2">In 1994, theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed a means of FTL space travel consistent with general relativity. Inspired by Star Trek, Alcubierre described an engine creating an energy field with lower density than the vacuum of space. By contracting space ahead of the ship and expanding it behind, a spacecraft could “ride a wave” forward.

            Unfortunately, Alcubierre's proposal raises the same theoretical problems as wormhole travel. Just as wormholes would require massive amounts of energy — and some as-yet unknown material to sustain it — so would warp drives. Star Trek provided that energy with a made-up element called dilithium: in crystal form, it is supposedly able to contain enormous, explosive reactions of matter and antimatter.
            
            If we want our own warp drive, we’re going to need a similar exotic energy process, unknown to current science.</p>
